Photographic record referenced as ev_drawerinspect_005.\n\nScope and Methodology: Visual and macro inspection of the front desk drawer lock, keyway, outer face, and slides; inspection of key cabinet slots for the front desk spare key; photographic documentation (ev_drawerinspect_005); comparison against operational condition; no destructive testing performed.\nMethodology (procedures):\n- Performed non-destructive visual and macro examination of the drawer lock face, keyway, bezel, adjacent wood laminate, and internal slides.\n- Used raking light and a hand lens to detect toolmarks, pry damage, or scraping.\n- Verified lock function (insert/turn/remove house key; open/close cycles) without altering components.\n- Inspected the key cabinet spare slot identifier for the front desk drawer key; noted occupancy status.\n- Captured close-up photographs with scale for measurements of any marks (ev_drawerinspect_005).\n- Cross-checked timeline and access records against doc_cashbox_missing_evidence_log_002.\n\nInstruments: LED raking light, 10× hand lens, metric ruler for scale, digital camera used for ev_drawerinspect_005.\nControls: No solvents or lubricants applied; environment remained as found.\n\nObservations: The drawer lock is intact with no visible pry marks, scratches, or toolmarks around the keyway. Drawer opens/closes smoothly. Key cabinet spare slot for the front desk drawer was observed empty at time of inspection. No foreign debris or scraping detected. The condition suggests normal keyed access rather than forced entry. Findings are consistent with photographs timestamped 2025-03-14T19:55:00-04:00 (ev_drawerinspect_005).\nResults:\n- Lock face and bezel show uniform, shallow wear consistent with normal handling; no radial gashes, torsion marks, or uplift of the bezel detected.\n- Keyway edges display smooth machining with no burrs or fresh scoring; macro images in ev_drawerinspect_005 confirm absence of tool-induced striations.\n- Drawer slides operate smoothly; no binding or misalignment consistent with prying.\n- No metal shavings, paint transfer, or foreign debris present around the lock or drawer interior.\n- The key cabinet spare slot labeled for the front desk drawer was empty at the time of inspection; this observation matches the description in ev_drawerinspect_005 and aligns with the sign-out entry in ev_keysignout_002 (doc_cashbox_missing_evidence_log_002).\n- CCTV corridor stills (ev_cctvstills_004) around 2025-03-14T18:45:52-04:00 to 2025-03-14T18:46:21-04:00 show movement but no identifiable subjects; these do not depict the lock or key use and provide no physical trace correlation.\n\nThese observations are consistent with normal keyed operation and not consistent with forced entry or tool attack.\n\nChain of Custody (Cadeia de Custódia): Item ev_drawerinspect_005 collected at 2025-03-14T19:55:00-04:00 at the front desk and key cabinet by Security (with Manager present). At 2025-03-14T20:02:00-04:00, digital images and notes were labeled and packaged in the security office. At 2025-03-14T20:12:00-04:00, custody was signed by the security technical lead for analysis. At 2025-03-14T20:40:00-04:00, analysis concluded and materials were re-sealed; remains stored in the security office evidence shelf.\nChain of Custody (ISO-8601, ordered):\n- 2025-03-14T19:55:00-04:00 — Collection: Security, with Manager present, captured inspection photographs and notes at the front desk and key cabinet (ev_drawerinspect_005).\n- 2025-03-14T20:02:00-04:00 — Packaging/Labeling: Security labeled digital files with evidence ID ev_drawerinspect_005 and packaged media in the security office; entry noted in doc_cashbox_missing_evidence_log_002.\n- 2025-03-14T20:12:00-04:00 — Transfer for Analysis: Custody signed to Security Technical Lead for examination; access limited to examiner.\n- 2025-03-14T20:40:00-04:00 — Analysis Concluded/Re-seal: Examiner completed non-destructive examination, re-sealed media, and returned ev_drawerinspect_005 to the security office evidence shelf.\n\nCustody remained continuous; no gaps or overlapping intervals recorded.\n\nAnalysis: Lack of damage indicates access via key rather than tampering. The empty spare key slot observed aligns with the sign-out record (ev_keysignout_002). No residue or trace evidence was recovered. Further analysis is limited by the absence of identifiable subjects in CCTV (ev_cctvstills_004).\nInterpretation:\n- The absence of pry indicators, torque deformation, or keyed-bypass artifacts supports normal keyed access.\n- The empty spare key slot at inspection is consistent with ev_keysignout_002 showing a sign-out at 2025-03-14T18:38:00-04:00. This is an access factor but does not establish misuse.\n- No residue (metal, plastic, adhesive) or latent trace was recovered; therefore, no material comparison can be conducted.\n- CCTV stills (ev_cctvstills_004) provide temporal context but lack subject identification and do not depict the drawer or lock in use.\n\nCorrelation: Findings align with the condition documented in ev_drawerinspect_005 and the administrative timeline in doc_cashbox_missing_police_report_001.\n\nConclusions and Limitations: No physical evidence of forced entry was observed. The report does not determine responsibility and should be read alongside witness statements and administrative records.\nConclusions:\n- Physical condition of the drawer lock and keyway is consistent with authorized key operation; forced entry is not supported by observed evidence.\n- The inspection confirms the spare key slot was empty at the time of examination.\n\nLimitations:\n- No fingerprints, DNA, or residue were collected during this non-destructive survey; identification of actors is beyond the scope of this report.\n- CCTV stills (ev_cctvstills_004) lack clarity for subject attribution.\n- This report should be read with witness statements (doc_cashbox_missing_witness_maya_004, doc_cashbox_missing_witness_colin_005, doc_cashbox_missing_witness_manager_006) and the evidence log (doc_cashbox_missing_evidence_log_002).

  "expectedRedTeamAnalysis": "Comprehensive red team analysis focused on temporal integrity, timeline logic, and chain-of-custody\n\nExecutive summary\n- Overall the case uses a consistent timezone (America/Toronto, -04:00 on 2025-03-14, which is correct for EDT). Most timestamps align and are plausible. \n- However, there are two high-priority temporal conflicts that need immediate correction: the evidence log compilation time occurring before later-listed evidence collection events, and the initial police report listing actions/results that occur after the report's creation time.\n- There are also medium-priority timeline clarity gaps (cash box movement in and out of the drawer between 17:15 and 18:55, and drawer lock state contradictions) that should be addressed to improve investigative coherence and training value.\n- Chain-of-custody for ev_drawerinspect_005 is well-ordered; other items are generally sound for a rookie difficulty, but custody chronology for the spare key itself is not documented and should be added.\n\nHigh-priority timestamp conflicts (require immediate correction)\n- Evidence log compiled time precedes later entries:\n  - Document: doc_cashbox_missing_evidence_log_002. Metadata states \"Compiled at 2025-03-14T19:32:00-04:00.\"\n  - Entries within the same log show collection times after 19:32:\n    - Entry 4 (ev_cctvstills_004) CollectedAt 2025-03-14T19:40:00-04:00.\n    - Entry 5 (ev_drawerinspect_005) CollectedAt 2025-03-14T19:55:00-04:00.\n  - Conflict: A log \"compiled at 19:32\" cannot contain entries that were collected at 19:40 and 19:55 unless the compilation time is updated or clearly versioned.\n  - Immediate fix options:\n    - Update log metadata to reflect incremental updates, e.g., \"Initialized 2025-03-14T19:32:00-04:00; updated through 2025-03-14T19:55:00-04:00.\"\n    - Alternatively, set the compiled time to at least 2025-03-14T20:00:00-04:00 (or later) to reflect inclusion of post-19:32 entries.\n    - Add a versioning note: \"v1 compiled 19:32; v2 updated 19:40; v3 updated 19:55.\"\n\n- Initial police report references post-creation actions/outcomes:\n  - Document: doc_cashbox_missing_police_report_001. Report created at 2025-03-14T19:28:00-04:00.\n  - \"Immediate Actions Taken\" section includes: \"Verified key cabinet entries (ev_keysignout_002); spare slot observed empty during inspection (ev_drawerinspect_005).\"\n  - ev_drawerinspect_005 was collected at 2025-03-14T19:55:00-04:00, after the report creation time.\n  - Also, it states \"scheduled and conducted witness statements,\" while witness statements occur at 20:05 (Maya), 20:15 (Colin), and 20:25 (Manager)—all after report creation.\n  - Immediate fix options:\n    - In the initial report, restrict \"Immediate Actions Taken\" to actions completed by 19:28 and note that subsequent actions will be documented in an addendum or later report.\n    - Add a report addendum (created ≥20:30) capturing outcomes from 19:55 inspection and 20:05+ statements, or adjust the initial report's creation time if it was indeed compiled later."
