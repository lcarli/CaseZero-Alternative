### Viewing Interface

Document reading happens inside the existing **File Viewer** application on the in-game desktop. We reuse the same window that already handles other file types, so opening a PDF feels identical to double-clicking a file on a real workstation.

**File Viewer layout:**

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  File Viewer · Incident Report 2023-0315    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Page 1 / 3        [Fit] [100%] [150%]      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                             │
│        RENDERED PDF CONTENT HERE            │
│                                             │
│   (standard vertical scroll, neutral bg)    │
│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Available behavior (all inherited from File Viewer):**

- Vertical scroll or Page Up/Down for pagination
- Simple zoom presets: Fit to width, 100%, 150%
- Native PDF rendering with antialiasing and soft gray background
- Copy text or drag images directly into the Notes app
- Light/Dark toggle follows the global desktop setting

**Intentionally not included:**

- Bookmarks, highlights, search, print, or any extra HUD widgets
- Automatic clue markers or summaries
- Overlay hints, guided reading, or extra navigation chrome

> Goal: let the detective open a PDF, read it comfortably, and close it—nothing more elaborate than a clean file viewer.

### Document Metadata

Each document has hidden metadata (not shown to player but affects gameplay):

```json
{
  "id": "DOC-001",
  "type": "PoliceReport",
  "title": "Incident Report #2023-0315",
  "fileName": "police-report-2023-0315.pdf",
  "author": "Officer Sarah Martinez",
  "dateCreated": "2023-03-16T08:00:00Z",
  "tags": ["initial", "official", "scene"],
  "availableAt": "start",
  "relatedEvidence": ["EV-001", "EV-002"],
  "relatedSuspects": ["SUSP-001", "SUSP-002"],
  "contradicts": ["DOC-003"],
  "pageCount": 3,
  "importance": "critical"
}
```

**Note:** Metadata is for design/testing only. Players discover relationships by reading.

## 3.3 Evidence Examination System

Viewing and analyzing physical evidence through photographs.

### Evidence Types

**Physical Evidence:**
- Weapons (guns, knives, blunt objects)
- Personal items (wallets, phones, keys)
- Clothing (bloodstained, torn, etc.)
- Tools (used in crime)

**Biological Evidence:**
- Blood samples
- Hair/fiber samples
- Bodily fluids
- Tissue samples

**Trace Evidence:**
- Fingerprints
- Footprints
- Tire tracks
- Paint chips

**Digital Evidence (Future):**
- Phone records
- Computer files
- Security footage screenshots

**Documents as Evidence:**
- Handwritten notes
- Forged documents
- Ransom notes
- Threatening letters

### Evidence Photo Presentation

Each evidence entry now shows **only one primary photo**. No alternate angles, no gallery controls—just the same kind of printed photo you would get in a physical cold-case binder.

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Evidence #EV-001: Firearm (.38 Caliber)     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                             │
│        PRIMARY PHOTO (with scale)           │
│                                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Type: Physical - Weapon                     │
│ Collected: 03/16/2023 02:00 AM             │
│ Location: Crime scene, near victim          │
│ Collected by: CSI Team Alpha                │
│                                             │
│ [🔬 Available Analyses: Ballistics,         │
│     Fingerprints]                           │
│ [📋 View Chain of Custody]                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

If we need to highlight a detail, it appears inside the supporting documents (e.g., circled in the police report) rather than as separate photos. This keeps the File Viewer simple and focused on reading.

## 3.4 Forensic Request System

The core time-based mechanic that creates pacing and anticipation.

### Forensic Analysis Types

> **Accelerated timing (new default):** players now see real-time minutes. Every real minute equals one in-world hour, so "12-hour" lab work finishes in 12 real minutes.

**DNA Analysis**
- **Accelerated Duration:** 24 minutes (equals 24 in-world hours)
- **Applied to:** Blood, hair, saliva, tissue
- **Results:** DNA profile, potential matches to suspects/database
- **Cost:** None (unlimited requests)
- **Example Output:** "DNA profile matches Michael Torres (99.7% confidence)"

**Ballistics Analysis**
- **Accelerated Duration:** 12 minutes (12h in-lore)
- **Applied to:** Firearms, bullets, casings
- **Results:** Weapon identification, trajectory, match to bullets
- **Example Output:** "Bullet recovered from victim fired from Evidence #EV-001"

**Fingerprint Analysis**
- **Accelerated Duration:** 8 minutes (8h in-lore)
- **Applied to:** Prints on surfaces, weapons, objects
- **Results:** Print identification, matches to suspects
- **Example Output:** "Partial print on weapon matches right thumb of SUSP-002"

**Toxicology**
- **Accelerated Duration:** 36 minutes (36h in-lore)
- **Applied to:** Blood samples, tissue
- **Results:** Drugs, poisons, alcohol levels
- **Example Output:** "Blood toxicology: 0.08% BAC, traces of sleeping medication"

**Trace Evidence Analysis**
- **Accelerated Duration:** 16 minutes (16h in-lore)
- **Applied to:** Fibers, hair, paint chips
- **Results:** Material identification, potential sources
- **Example Output:** "Fiber matches carpet in suspect's vehicle"

**Handwriting Analysis**
- **Accelerated Duration:** 10 minutes (10h in-lore)
- **Applied to:** Written documents
- **Results:** Author identification, forgery detection
- **Example Output:** "Signature on document likely forged"

**Digital Forensics (Future)**
- **Accelerated Duration:** 48 minutes (48h in-lore)
- **Applied to:** Phones, computers, storage
- **Results:** Deleted files, metadata, communication logs

### Request Flow

⏱ EV-004 - DNA Analysis
  In Progress (24 real min / 24h in-world remaining)
```

When a lab report finishes, the player receives a **plain email from the Forensics Lab** (subject line "Report Ready", short body listing the evidence ID plus a "Download report" link). Clicking the link pushes the PDF into the in-game **File Viewer**, so it opens exactly like any other digital dossier page.

### Time Mechanics

**Accelerated Mode (now the default):**
- UI shows real minutes that map 1:1 to in-world hours
- A "12-hour" report finishes in 12 real minutes
- Keeps procedural weight without multi-hour waits
- Can be disabled in settings for players who want the long-form experience

**Real-Time Mode (optional):**
- Restores the original hour-long timers
- Player can close the game and return later
- Progress persists server-side
- Great for long streams or slow-burn roleplay

**Instant Mode (Accessibility):**
- All analyses complete immediately
- For players with limited time
- Clearly labeled as "Story Mode"
- No rank progression in this mode

### Multiple Requests

**Parallel Processing:**
- ✅ Can request multiple analyses simultaneously
- ✅ Each runs on independent timer
- ✅ No queue or slot limits
- ✅ All complete at their scheduled times

**Example Timeline:**

```text
02:00 AM in-world (T+0 real min)  - Request Ballistics (12 min), DNA (24 min), Fingerprints (8 min)
10:00 AM in-world (T+8 real min)  - Fingerprints ready
02:00 PM in-world (T+12 real min) - Ballistics ready
02:00 AM next day in-world (T+24 real min) - DNA ready
```

### Timeline Data Source

**Automatically Populated From:**
- Document timestamps
- Witness statement times
- Forensic estimates
- Security logs
- CCTV data

**Players Cannot:**
- ❌ Add custom events (data must come from case files)
- ❌ Edit event descriptions
- ❌ Change timestamps

**Players Can:**
- ✅ View events chronologically
- ✅ Filter by source (CCTV, witnesses, etc.)
- ✅ Click event to see source document
- ✅ Identify gaps in timeline

### Design Purpose

**Why Include Timeline:**
- Helps visualize sequence of events
- Makes gaps obvious (where we don't know what happened)
- Useful for identifying alibi conflicts
- Reduces cognitive load of remembering timestamps

**Why Keep It Simple:**
- Not a puzzle to solve
- Just a visual aid
- Data comes from documents (no hidden info)
- Player still does analysis

### Attempt Limit Rationale

**Why 3 Attempts?**
1. **Prevents Guessing:** Can't just try every suspect
2. **Adds Stakes:** Makes submission meaningful
3. **Encourages Thoroughness:** Players investigate fully before submitting
4. **Realistic:** Real detectives need strong evidence before accusing

**Why Not Infinite?**
- Would encourage trial-and-error over deduction
- Removes tension from submission
- Players wouldn't take it seriously

**Why Not 1 Attempt?**
- Too punishing for honest mistakes
- Doesn't allow learning from error
- Would frustrate players

## 3.8 Case Session Management

Behind-the-scenes system managing player progress.

### Session Data

**What's Tracked:**
```json
{
  "sessionId": "uuid-123",
  "userId": "user-456",
  "caseId": "CASE-2024-001",
  "startedAt": "2023-11-13T14:00:00Z",
  "lastAccessAt": "2023-11-13T15:30:00Z",
  "status": "Active",
  "progress": {
    "documentsRead": ["DOC-001", "DOC-002", "DOC-005"],
    "evidenceViewed": ["EV-001", "EV-004"],
    "forensicRequests": [
      {
        "id": "req-1",
        "evidenceId": "EV-001",
        "analysisType": "Ballistics",
        "requestedAt": "2023-11-13T14:30:00Z",
        "completedAt": "2023-11-14T02:30:00Z",
        "status": "Pending"
      }
    ],
    "notebookEntries": ["Suspect analysis", "Timeline notes"],
    "submissionAttempts": 0,
    "timeSpent": 5400
  }
}
```

**What's NOT Tracked:**
- ❌ Which documents were read first (no forced order)
- ❌ How long on each document (no speed metrics)
- ❌ Mouse movements or "interest" heatmaps
- ❌ Number of times evidence viewed (irrelevant)

### Save System

**Auto-Save:**
- Every 30 seconds
- On window focus loss
- On app close
- On navigation away from case

**Manual Save:**
- Not needed (always auto-saving)
- No "save slots" (one save per case per user)

**Resume:**
- Opens exactly where left off
- Forensics timers continue server-side
- Notes preserved
- Window positions saved (optional)

## 3.9 Detective Progression System

Long-term advancement through ranks.

### Rank Structure

**Official ranks (8 tiers):** same ladder already shown on in-game profiles – we are only redefining how promotions trigger.

1. **Rookie**
  - Starting rank
  - Access to Easy cases
  - **Requirement:** 0 solved cases (tutorial completion only)

2. **Detective III**
  - First real step in the career
  - Unlocks Medium cases
  - **Requirement:** 1 archived case solved with a correct verdict

3. **Detective II**
  - Shows consistency
  - Medium cases feel routine
  - **Requirement:** 3 solved cases (at least 1 Medium)

4. **Detective I**
  - Experienced investigator
  - Gains access to Hard cases
  - **Requirement:** 6 solved cases (at least 2 Medium/Hard)

5. **Senior Detective**
  - Master of fundamentals
  - Hard cases become common
  - **Requirement:** 10 solved cases (at least 3 Hard)

6. **Lead Detective**
  - Technical reference point
  - Invited to Expert cases
  - **Requirement:** 15 solved cases (at least 2 Expert)

7. **Veteran Detective**
  - Elite status
  - Expert dossiers feel attainable
  - **Requirement:** 21 solved cases (at least 3 Expert)

8. **Master Detective**
  - Highest badge in the ranking
  - All archived content unlocked
  - **Requirement:** 28 solved cases (at least 5 Expert)

### Case Logging & Timekeeping

- No XP, no score multipliers—**progression equals solved cases**.
- When the player submits the final report and gets the verdict right we only persist:
  - `caseId`
  - `difficulty`
  - `resolvedAt`
  - `elapsedMinutes` (total time spent on that case)
- `elapsedMinutes` feeds the internal leaderboard (“best time in the department”) and post-case emails.
- The server stores one row per solved case; there is no cumulative XP counter.

### Promotion Flow

1. Player solves a cold case.
2. System stores the elapsed time and increments the `casesSolved` counter.
3. Promotion service checks whether rank requirements (total solved + difficulty quota) are met.
4. If yes, the profile rank updates immediately and new case categories unlock.
5. Only solve count + per-case time remain in the save; no other numeric grind is persisted.

### Rank Benefits

**What Ranks Unlock:**
- ✅ Access to harder cases (gating)
- ✅ New case categories (when available)
- ✅ Profile badge/title

**What Ranks DON'T Give:**
- ❌ Mechanical advantages
- ❌ Faster forensics
- ❌ Better hints (there are no hints)
- ❌ Extra submission attempts
- ❌ Easier cases

**Philosophy:** Ranks reflect mastery, not power

### Suspect Count Guidelines

- **Easy Cases:** 2-3 suspects
- **Medium Cases:** 4-5 suspects
- **Hard Cases:** 6-7 suspects
- **Expert Cases:** 8+ suspects

### Red Herrings

**Innocent Suspects Must Be:**
- Plausible as culprits
- Have weak alibis or suspicious behavior
- Connected to victim
- Have apparent motives

**But Eventually:**
- Evidence exonerates them
- Alibi checks out on close examination
- Motive is less strong than it appears

**Example:**
- **Linda Chen (Wife):** Benefits from life insurance, but DNA places her at home during murder, CCTV confirms she didn't leave house

## 3.14 Anti-Patterns (What We Avoid)

Mechanics deliberately NOT included:

### ❌ Hint System
**Why not:** Undermines player autonomy and deduction

### ❌ Objective List
**Why not:** Makes investigation prescriptive instead of exploratory

### ❌ Quest Markers
**Why not:** Removes the "figure it out yourself" challenge

### ❌ Mini-Games
**Why not:** Breaks immersion and authentic investigation feel

### ❌ Skill Checks/Stats
**Why not:** Player's real intelligence is the "stat"

### ❌ Inventory Management
**Why not:** All evidence is in lab, no collecting/carrying

### ❌ Resource Scarcity
**Why not:** Unlimited forensics, no money system, no artificial limits

### ❌ Energy/Stamina
**Why not:** Investigate as long as you want

### ❌ Daily Missions
**Why not:** Manipulative engagement pattern

### ❌ Social Pressure
**Why not:** No "your friend solved this faster"

## 3.15 Edge Case Handling

How systems handle unusual player behavior:

### Player Never Requests Forensics
**System Response:**
- ✅ Still allowed to submit solution
- ✅ Can solve without forensics (if smart enough)
- ❌ Won't get pestered to use forensics
- 🎖️ Get "Detective's Intuition" badge if correct

### Player Requests Everything Immediately
**System Response:**
- ✅ All requests accepted
- ⏱️ All timers run in parallel
- No punishment or penalty

### Player Takes 6 Months to Finish Case
**System Response:**
- ✅ All progress saved
- ✅ Forensics completed long ago
- 📝 "Case Summary" button to refresh memory
- No penalties for long breaks

### Player Copies Suspect Name Without Reading
**System Response:**
- ⚠️ Explanation field is required (prevents blind guessing)
- Must provide motive and method
- System detects copy-paste (future: flag suspicious submissions)

### Player Abandons Tutorial
**System Response:**
- ✅ Can skip and go straight to cases
- ✅ Help documentation available
- ❌ No forced re-tutorial

---

## 3.16 Metrics & Telemetry

What we measure (respectfully):

### Tracked Anonymously:
- ✅ Case completion rates
- ✅ Average time to solution
- ✅ Submission attempt distribution
- ✅ Forensics usage rates
- ✅ Document view counts (aggregate)

### NOT Tracked:
- ❌ Individual document reading time
- ❌ Exact player behavior patterns
- ❌ Mouse movements or clicks
- ❌ Personal investigation notes
- ❌ Anything that feels invasive

### Purpose:
- Balance difficulty
- Identify confusing cases
- Improve design
- NOT for engagement manipulation
