## 🎯 Writing Guidelines

### For Each Chapter:
1. **Start with overview** - 2-3 sentences summarizing the chapter
2. **Use clear sections** - Break into digestible subsections
3. **Include examples** - Concrete examples over abstract theory
4. **Add diagrams** - Visual aids where helpful (ASCII art, mermaid, etc.)
5. **Reference other chapters** - Link to related sections
6. **Keep it updated** - Mark revision date at bottom
7. **Be specific** - Avoid vague language, give exact numbers/rules

### Tone:
- Professional but readable
- Developer-focused (they're the primary audience)
- Prescriptive (this is HOW, not just WHAT)
- Complete (don't leave gaps)

### Length:
- Core chapters: 3-5 pages
- Technical chapters: 5-8 pages
- Content chapters: 4-6 pages
- Appendices: As needed

## 💡 Context Preservation Strategy

### Per Session:
- Work on 1 chapter at a time
- Complete all sections before moving to next
- Update MAIN.md status after each chapter
- Cross-reference completed chapters

### Between Sessions:
- Always start by reading MAIN.md
- Review last completed chapter
- Check task list for next priority
- Update progress tracker

### Quality Checks:
- [ ] All sections have content (no TODOs)
- [ ] Examples are concrete and clear
- [ ] Links to other chapters work
- [ ] Diagrams render correctly
- [ ] No contradictions with other chapters
- [ ] Revision date is current
