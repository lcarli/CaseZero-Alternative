# Chapter 06 - Progression & Advancement

**Game Design Document - CaseZero v3.0**  
**Last Updated:** November 13, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

> ### ⚠️ Implementation status
>
> This chapter is the **original design vision** for progression and is largely **aspirational** — most of it (the 8-rank ladder, the XP formula, XP-based promotion, hour/case estimates) has **not** been implemented as written. Treat it as a **design goal / roadmap reference**, not as a description of the live game.
>
> **What is actually implemented today** (`backend/CaseZeroApi/Models/User.cs`, `backend/CaseZeroApi/Services/PromotionRules.cs`, `schemas/case.schema.json`):
> - **7 ranks / difficulty levels**, shared by cases and detectives: `Rookie → Detective → Detective2 → Sergeant → Lieutenant → Captain → Commander`.
> - Promotion is **not XP-based**. It is driven by **cumulative graded-correct case resolves** since account creation, with fixed thresholds: Rookie = 0, Detective = 3, Detective2 = 8, Sergeant = 16, Lieutenant = 28, Captain = 44, Commander = 65 resolved cases.
> - There is no XP number, no per-difficulty XP formula, and no attempt-based XP penalty/bonus system in the codebase today.
>
> The rest of this chapter (§6.3–§6.9) describes the **8-rank / XP-driven system as originally envisioned**. It is kept for design-history and future-iteration purposes; do not treat the specific rank names ("Senior Detective", "Master Detective", etc.), XP numbers, or hour estimates below as current facts.

## 6.1 Overview

This chapter defines the **detective rank progression system** - how players advance through their career, unlock new cases, and track their investigative mastery. The system is designed to feel like genuine career progression rather than gamified leveling.

**Key Concepts:**
- 8 detective ranks (Rookie → Master Detective)
- XP earned from solving cases
- Rank-based case unlocking
- Performance tracking and statistics
- No mechanical advantages (only content access)
- Long-term mastery goals

---

## 6.2 Philosophy of Progression

### What Progression IS

**Career Advancement:**
- Reflects growing expertise
- Unlocks more complex cases
- Tracks investigative achievements
- Shows mastery over time

**Recognition System:**
- Acknowledges player skill
- Provides sense of growth
- Creates long-term goals
- Encourages thorough investigation

### What Progression is NOT

**No Power Creep:**
- ❌ No faster forensics at higher ranks
- ❌ No extra submission attempts
- ❌ No hints or assistance unlocked
- ❌ No easier evidence discovery

**No Manipulation:**
- ❌ No daily login bonuses
- ❌ No "energy" systems
- ❌ No time-gated progression
- ❌ No pressure to advance quickly

**Core Principle:** Ranks measure skill, not time investment or payment.

## 6.4 Experience Points (XP) System

### XP Award Formula

**Base XP by Difficulty:**

```javascript
const baseXP = {
  Easy: 150,
  Medium: 300,
  Hard: 600,
  Expert: 1200
};
```

**Modifiers:**

```javascript
function calculateXP(difficulty, attempt, bonuses) {
  let xp = baseXP[difficulty];
  
  // Attempt penalty
  if (attempt === 2) {
    xp *= 0.75; // -25%
  } else if (attempt === 3) {
    xp *= 0.50; // -50%
  } else if (attempt > 3) {
    xp = 0; // Failed case
  }
  
  // Bonuses
  if (bonuses.firstAttempt) {
    xp *= 1.5; // +50% for first-try solve
  }
  
  if (bonuses.noForensics) {
    xp *= 1.25; // +25% for solving without forensics (rare)
  }
  
  if (bonuses.quickSolve) {
    xp *= 1.1; // +10% for solving in under 2 hours
  }
  
  if (bonuses.thoroughExplanation) {
    xp *= 1.1; // +10% for detailed solution explanation
  }
  
  return Math.floor(xp);
}
```

### XP Examples

**Easy Case (150 base XP):**
- First attempt, quick: 150 × 1.5 × 1.1 = **248 XP**
- Second attempt: 150 × 0.75 = **113 XP**
- Third attempt: 150 × 0.5 = **75 XP**

**Medium Case (300 base XP):**
- First attempt: 300 × 1.5 = **450 XP**
- First attempt + thorough explanation: 300 × 1.5 × 1.1 = **495 XP**
- Second attempt: 300 × 0.75 = **225 XP**
- Third attempt: 300 × 0.5 = **150 XP**

**Hard Case (600 base XP):**
- First attempt: 600 × 1.5 = **900 XP**
- First attempt + all bonuses: 600 × 1.5 × 1.1 × 1.1 = **1089 XP**
- Second attempt: 600 × 0.75 = **450 XP**
- Third attempt: 600 × 0.5 = **300 XP**

**Expert Case (1200 base XP):**

## 6.5 Case Unlocking System

### Unlock Rules

**Difficulty Gating:**

```javascript
const caseUnlockRequirements = {
  Easy: "Rookie", // Rank 1+
  Medium: "Detective III", // Rank 2+
  Hard: "Detective I", // Rank 4+
  Expert: "Lead Detective" // Rank 6+
};
```

**Progressive Unlock:**
- All Easy cases available at Rookie
- Medium unlocks at Detective III (after first case solved)
- Hard unlocks at Detective I (after proving competence)

### Why Gate Difficulty?

**Prevents Frustration:**
- New players won't face expert cases immediately
- Ensures skill development before harder content
- Creates sense of progression

**Maintains Challenge:**
- Players always have appropriate difficulty available
- Harder cases feel like earned achievements
- Prevents burnout from too-hard content

**Doesn't Block Content:**
- Can still play easier cases at high ranks
- No "out-leveling" content
- All cases remain relevant

**Philosophy:** Hidden achievements reward excellence without pressure.

---

## 6.12 Rank Reset & Prestige (Not Planned)

### Why No Prestige System?

**Arguments Against:**
1. **No mechanical changes:** Since ranks don't give power, prestige is meaningless
2. **Content access loss:** Would lock players out of hard cases they earned
3. **Artificial grind:** Extends playtime artificially, not through content
4. **Premium model:** Players paid for content, shouldn't re-grind

**Philosophy:** Mastery is the end goal, not infinite grinding.

**Alternative:** New case DLC packs extend content without resetting progress.

---

## 6.13 Seasonal Content (Future Consideration)

### Seasonal Cases (Post-Launch)

**Concept:**
- Limited-time special cases (1-2 months)
- Available to all ranks (no gating)
- Unique themes (holidays, historical)
- Earn special badges
- Cases archived but replayable after season

**Example:**
```
WINTER SEASON 2025: "The Holiday Heist"
Duration: Dec 1 - Jan 31
Cases: 3 new cases (Easy, Medium, Hard)
Theme: Holiday-themed crimes
Reward: Seasonal badge
```

**Why Seasonal?**
- Keeps community engaged
- Fresh content regularly
- Optional (doesn't gate base game)
- Replayable after season ends

**Note:** Only if successful at launch. Not core to MVP.
