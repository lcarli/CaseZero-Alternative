INVESTIGATIVE MEMO

TO: Detective Assigned to CASE-2023-001
FROM: Forensics Laboratory
DATE: January 13, 2024
TIME: 14:30
SUBJECT: Lab Analysis Update - Priority Results

====================================================================

Detective,

Wanted to update you immediately on the analysis results from the backpack evidence. We've been working around the clock to process all items, and the results are significant.

DNA ANALYSIS - COMPLETED:
The DNA analysis has confirmed what we suspected. Sarah Mitchell's DNA is present on all personal items as expected, but we also have a strong secondary profile that came back as a match in the system.

Thomas Brennan's DNA is present on the backpack shoulder straps and water bottle. The quantity and distribution suggest direct handling, not secondary transfer. This places him in physical contact with the victim's personal property.

FINGERPRINT ANALYSIS - COMPLETED:
Results mirror the DNA findings. Brennan's fingerprints are on both shoulder straps, the main zipper, and the water bottle. Multiple clear prints suitable for court testimony.

TRACE EVIDENCE - IN PROGRESS:
Preliminary findings show fabric fibers on the backpack that don't match any of the victim's clothing. These appear to be from work-type clothing - possibly maintenance uniform material. Full analysis will be complete by end of week.

ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS - SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS:
The soil analysis from the discovery site is revealing. We found tool marks consistent with a folding shovel or similar digging implement. Also recovered synthetic fabric fibers that match the type used in work uniforms.

Most importantly, we found traces of motor oil and diesel fuel in the soil that suggest a work vehicle was present at the site. This is not naturally occurring in that environment.

DIGITAL ENHANCEMENT UPDATE:
Working on enhancing the security footage from the university. We're also analyzing metadata from the victim's phone records and may have additional leads developing.

INVESTIGATIVE IMPLICATIONS:
The evidence strongly suggests Brennan had direct contact with the victim's property and was involved in transporting it to the disposal site. Recommend immediate re-interview with this new evidence.

The soil analysis suggests he used work-related tools and possibly a work vehicle to access the remote disposal site. You may want to examine any vehicles he has access to through his employment.

TIME SENSITIVITY:
Given the strength of the forensic evidence, recommend moving quickly on any additional interviews or search warrants. The lab results provide probable cause for more aggressive investigative actions.

Will have complete written reports by end of business today. Call if you need any clarification on the findings.
