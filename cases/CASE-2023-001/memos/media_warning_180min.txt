FROM: Chief Parker
DATE: January 15, 2024
TIME: 15:00
SUBJECT: Media Coverage - Exercise Caution

====================================================================

Detective,

The Sarah Mitchell cold case reopening has attracted significant media attention. Channel 7 News ran a story this morning about the backpack discovery, and we're getting calls from multiple news outlets.

CURRENT MEDIA SITUATION:
- Local television stations requesting interviews
- Newspaper reporters asking for case updates  
- Social media speculation increasing
- Victim's family has been contacted by press

IMMEDIATE PROTOCOLS:
1. DO NOT discuss case details with any media representatives
2. Refer all media inquiries to PIO Jenkins immediately
3. Avoid any public locations where you might be approached
4. Be aware that witnesses and suspects may be contacted by press

FAMILY CONSIDERATIONS:
The Mitchell family is hopeful but fragile. They've waited almost a year for answers. Any information leaks could compromise both the investigation and their emotional well-being.

INVESTIGATIVE SECURITY:
- Assume all suspects are now aware of renewed investigation
- Some may attempt to dispose of evidence or alter alibis
- Monitor social media for any suspect communications
- Consider surveillance if warranted by evidence

PROSECUTION CONCERNS:
DA Martinez has been briefed on the media situation. She emphasizes the need to preserve case integrity for potential prosecution. Any compromised evidence or contaminated witness pool could jeopardize charges.

DEPARTMENT REPUTATION:
This case is being watched closely by city administration and the community. A successful resolution will demonstrate our commitment to cold cases, but any missteps will be highly scrutinized.

Stay focused on the investigation. Let PIO Jenkins handle the media circus.

Keep me informed of any developments.

Chief Parker
