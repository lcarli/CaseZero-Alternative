====================================================================

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: This interview is being recorded. It is March 17th, 2023, 2:30 PM. I'm Detective Rodriguez, this is Detective Park. We're interviewing Thomas Brennan regarding the disappearance of Sarah Mitchell. Mr. Brennan, you've been read your rights and you understand you're here voluntarily?

BRENNAN: Yes, ma'am. I want to help any way I can. This is terrible what happened to that girl.

DETECTIVE PARK: Tell us about your job at Riverside Apartments.

BRENNAN: I've been maintenance supervisor there for about three years. Good job, steady work. I handle all the repairs, maintenance requests, that sort of thing.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: How well did you know Sarah Mitchell?

BRENNAN: Not very well. Saw her around, you know? Nice girl, always polite when she had maintenance requests. Quiet type.

DETECTIVE PARK: What kind of maintenance requests did she have?

BRENNAN: Oh, the usual stuff. Leaky faucet couple months ago, some outlet problems. Her and her roommate were good tenants, never caused trouble.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: When was the last time you saw Sarah?

BRENNAN: [pause] Uh, let me think... probably earlier this week sometime. Monday or Tuesday maybe? Hard to keep track, I see all the tenants regularly.

DETECTIVE PARK: Can you be more specific? 

BRENNAN: Well, I was working on the heating system in the basement Wednesday, and I think I saw her going to the laundry room. But I couldn't swear to it.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: What about Thursday, March 15th? Where were you that evening?

BRENNAN: Thursday? I finished work around 6 PM, went home to my family. Had dinner, watched TV. Nothing special.

DETECTIVE PARK: Anyone who can verify that?

BRENNAN: My wife Carol, my kids. We had dinner together, watched that cooking show Carol likes.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Do you have access to all the apartments?

BRENNAN: Well, yeah, I have to for emergencies and maintenance. All maintenance staff do. It's part of the job.

DETECTIVE PARK: Including Sarah's apartment?

BRENNAN: [shifting in chair] If there was a maintenance request, sure. But I don't just go into people's apartments without permission. That would be wrong.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Have you ever been in Sarah's apartment when she wasn't there?

BRENNAN: [long pause] Only for emergencies. Like when the upstairs unit had a leak and I had to check for water damage. Standard procedure.

DETECTIVE PARK: How often would you say you've been in her apartment?

BRENNAN: [defensive] I don't keep count. Maybe four or five times total in three years? Always for legitimate reasons.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Did you ever have personal conversations with Sarah?

BRENNAN: Not really personal, no. Just work stuff. "How's the faucet working?" "Any other problems?" That sort of thing.

DETECTIVE PARK: Did you know her schedule? When she was usually home?

BRENNAN: [nervous] Not specifically, no. I mean, you notice patterns when you work at a place. Students are usually at school during the day. Nothing unusual about that.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Several tenants mentioned you asked about Sarah's schedule specifically. Can you explain that?

BRENNAN: [agitated] I might have asked when would be a good time to do repairs so I wouldn't disturb her studies. That's just being considerate.

DETECTIVE PARK: Mrs. Patterson in 3A said you asked her specifically when Sarah goes to the library.

BRENNAN: [sweating] I... I don't remember that conversation. Maybe she misunderstood. I ask about everyone's schedules for maintenance planning.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Do you know the hiking trails around the area?

BRENNAN: [sudden change in demeanor] What does that have to do with anything?

DETECTIVE PARK: Just answer the question, please.

BRENNAN: I've lived here my whole life. Sure, I know the trails. Used to hunt with my dad when I was younger.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Any particular trails you frequent?

BRENNAN: Not really anymore. Don't have time for hiking with work and family.

DETECTIVE PARK: What about the trails behind Miller's Ridge?

BRENNAN: [long pause] I've been there a few times over the years. Why?

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Have you ever given Sarah a ride anywhere?

BRENNAN: No. Never.

DETECTIVE PARK: Have you ever called her personal phone number?

BRENNAN: [quickly] No. Why would I? If there's a maintenance issue, I knock on the door or leave a note.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Do you own any cell phones besides your main number?

BRENNAN: [hesitant] What do you mean?

DETECTIVE PARK: Any prepaid phones, work phones, phones registered to other people?

BRENNAN: [shifting nervously] My nephew asked me to buy him a prepaid phone last week for his birthday. Kids these days want their own phones.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: What number was that phone?

BRENNAN: I don't remember. It was just a gift.

DETECTIVE PARK: Where is that phone now?

BRENNAN: [sweating more] I gave it to him. Like I said, it was a birthday present.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: What's your nephew's name?

BRENNAN: [long pause] Danny. Danny Brennan. He's 16.

DETECTIVE PARK: We'll need to verify that. Can you provide his contact information?

BRENNAN: [agitated] Look, why are you asking about phones? I thought this was about Sarah being missing.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: We're following up on all leads. Is there anything else you want to tell us about Sarah or the night she disappeared?

BRENNAN: [standing up] I've told you everything I know. I had nothing to do with whatever happened to her. I'm a family man, I go to church, I help people for a living.

DETECTIVE PARK: No one's accusing you of anything, Mr. Brennan. We're just gathering information.

BRENNAN: [sitting back down] I just... I hope you find her. She seemed like a good kid.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: If you think of anything else, please contact us immediately.

BRENNAN: Of course. Can I go now? My wife's expecting me home.

DETECTIVE PARK: Yes, you're free to leave. Thank you for coming in.
