====================================================================

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: This interview is being recorded. It is March 17th, 2023, 10:00 AM. I'm Detective Rodriguez, this is Detective Park. We're interviewing Marcus Chen regarding the disappearance of Sarah Mitchell. Mr. Chen, you understand you're here voluntarily?

CHEN: Yes. I want to help find Sarah. This is... this is really scary.

DETECTIVE PARK: How long did you know Sarah Mitchell?

CHEN: We dated for about eight months. Met in the graduate program orientation last fall. We were together until January.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: What led to the breakup?

CHEN: [sighs] It was complicated. We wanted different things. She felt I was too... controlling, I guess. I just cared about her a lot.

DETECTIVE PARK: Can you elaborate on "controlling"?

CHEN: [defensive] I wouldn't call it controlling. I worried about her safety, wanted to spend time with her. Sometimes I'd text to check in, make sure she got home okay. She said it was "too much."

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: How often were you texting her?

CHEN: [pause] I don't know... maybe 10 or 15 times a day? We were dating. Couples communicate.

DETECTIVE PARK: What was your relationship like after the breakup?

CHEN: [agitated] Difficult. I didn't want it to end. I thought we could work things out if we just talked more.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Did you continue to contact her after she asked you to stop?

CHEN: [long pause] I... yes, sometimes. But only because I cared about her. I knew she was making a mistake.

DETECTIVE PARK: Tell us about your contact with Sarah this week.

CHEN: I texted her a few times. Monday, I think, and again on Wednesday. I wanted to meet up and talk.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: What was her response?

CHEN: She said she needed space. But I thought if I could just explain how I felt...

DETECTIVE PARK: Did you go to her apartment recently?

CHEN: [shifting uncomfortably] I stopped by Tuesday to return some of her books. I still had a key from when we were dating.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: She didn't invite you over?

CHEN: No, but I thought... I mean, they were her books. She needed them for class.

DETECTIVE PARK: How did she react when you showed up?

CHEN: [angry] She was upset. Said I was "violating her boundaries." Her roommate was there acting all protective. Sarah asked for the key back.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Did you give her the key?

CHEN: [reluctant] Eventually, yes. But I told her she was overreacting.

DETECTIVE PARK: Where were you on the evening of March 15th?

CHEN: At home studying. I have a big paper due next week.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Anyone who can verify that?

CHEN: I live alone, so no. But I was online - you can check my computer activity. I was working on my research.

DETECTIVE PARK: What time did you start studying that evening?

CHEN: Right after dinner, maybe 7:00? I ordered Chinese food around 6:30.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Did you try to contact Sarah that evening?

CHEN: [hesitant] I... yes. I sent her a text around 8:00.

DETECTIVE PARK: What did the text say?

CHEN: I asked if she wanted to get coffee and talk. I knew she'd be at the library.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: How did you know she'd be at the library?

CHEN: [realizing his mistake] She... she always studied there on Thursday evenings. I knew her schedule.

DETECTIVE PARK: Did she respond to your text?

CHEN: No. She never responded.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: How did that make you feel?

CHEN: [emotional] Frustrated. Angry. I just wanted to talk to her, and she was treating me like some kind of stalker.

DETECTIVE PARK: Have you ever followed Sarah or watched her activities?

CHEN: [defensive] I wouldn't call it following. Sometimes I'd see her on campus and say hi. We go to the same school.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Did you ever go to the library when you knew she'd be there?

CHEN: [long pause] Maybe once or twice. But just to study. It's a public place.

DETECTIVE PARK: Tell us about Sarah's other relationships. Any problems with other people?

CHEN: [suddenly animated] Yes! That professor of hers, Dr. Morrison. Something was going on there. The way she talked about their meetings...

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: What about Dr. Morrison concerned you?

CHEN: Sarah mentioned he kept scheduling evening meetings, wanting to work "more closely" with her. It didn't sound right.

DETECTIVE PARK: Did Sarah say anything specific about Dr. Morrison?

CHEN: She said he made her uncomfortable. I told her she should report it, but she was worried about her thesis.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Anyone else you were concerned about?

CHEN: That creepy maintenance guy at her apartment. Tommy something. I saw how he looked at her when I was there.

DETECTIVE PARK: What do you mean by "how he looked at her"?

CHEN: [animated] Like he was memorizing her. And he always found excuses to hang around when she was in the laundry room or lobby.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Did you ever confront this maintenance worker?

CHEN: No, but I told Sarah to be careful around him. She said I was being paranoid.

DETECTIVE PARK: Going back to March 15th - did you leave your apartment at all that evening?

CHEN: [quickly] No. I was studying all night.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: No trips to the store, taking out trash, anything like that?

CHEN: [sweating] Maybe to take out trash around 9:00? But just to the dumpster behind my building.

DETECTIVE PARK: How long were you outside?

CHEN: [nervous] Just a few minutes. It's right behind the building.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Your building is about a mile from Sarah's apartment complex, correct?

CHEN: [defensive] I guess, but I didn't go anywhere near there.

DETECTIVE PARK: Do you own a car?

CHEN: Yes, a 2018 Honda Civic. Blue.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Was your car at home all evening on March 15th?

CHEN: [pause] Yes. I told you, I was studying.

DETECTIVE PARK: Mr. Chen, is there anything else you want to tell us about Sarah or that evening?

CHEN: [breaking down] I just want her to be okay. I know our relationship ended badly, but I never wanted anything bad to happen to her.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Did you ever threaten Sarah in any way?

CHEN: [shocked] No! Never! I loved her. I would never hurt her.

DETECTIVE PARK: Even when you were angry about the breakup?

CHEN: [crying] Sometimes I said things I didn't mean. But I would never physically hurt her. I just wanted her back.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: What kind of things did you say?

CHEN: [reluctant] I told her she'd regret leaving me. That she didn't know what was good for her. But I meant she'd miss our relationship, not... not anything bad.

DETECTIVE PARK: Is there anything else you think we should know?

CHEN: [wiping eyes] Just please find her. Whatever happened, she doesn't deserve this.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: We'll need you to provide a DNA sample and fingerprints for elimination purposes.

CHEN: Of course. Whatever helps.
