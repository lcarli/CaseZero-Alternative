====================================================================

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: This interview is being recorded with Dr. Morrison's permission. It is March 18th, 2023, 3:00 PM. I'm Detective Rodriguez, this is Detective Park. Dr. Morrison, thank you for agreeing to meet with us.

DR. MORRISON: Of course. This is a terrible situation. I want to help however I can.

DETECTIVE PARK: How long have you been Sarah Mitchell's thesis advisor?

DR. MORRISON: Since the beginning of this academic year. September, I believe. She was assigned to me based on her research interests in cognitive behavioral therapy.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: How would you describe your working relationship with Sarah?

DR. MORRISON: [pausing] Professional. She's a dedicated student, though she's been struggling with her research direction lately.

DETECTIVE PARK: What kind of struggles?

DR. MORRISON: Her thesis proposal needed significant revisions. The methodology wasn't sound, and her literature review was... incomplete. I've been trying to guide her toward a more viable project.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: How often do you meet with Sarah?

DR. MORRISON: Typically weekly. Sometimes more frequently when deadlines approach or when she needs additional guidance.

DETECTIVE PARK: Do these meetings always take place during regular office hours?

DR. MORRISON: [slight hesitation] Usually, yes. Occasionally we need to meet in the evenings when my schedule is less busy.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: How does Sarah feel about evening meetings?

DR. MORRISON: [defensive] She's never complained. Graduate students understand that research doesn't follow a 9-to-5 schedule.

DETECTIVE PARK: Has Sarah seemed uncomfortable during any of your interactions?

DR. MORRISON: [measured response] She's been under stress lately. That's normal for graduate students, especially those struggling academically.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: We understand there have been some concerns raised about your interactions with female students.

DR. MORRISON: [stiffening] I'm not sure what you're referring to. My relationships with all students are strictly professional.

DETECTIVE PARK: Are you aware that the university ethics committee is reviewing your conduct?

DR. MORRISON: [angry] That's a baseless complaint from a disgruntled student who didn't like her grade. It has nothing to do with Sarah.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Tell us about your last meeting with Sarah.

DR. MORRISON: It was scheduled for Friday, March 16th. She never showed up, which was unlike her.

DETECTIVE PARK: When did you realize she hadn't arrived?

DR. MORRISON: I waited until about 2:30. The meeting was scheduled for 2:00. After that, I assumed she'd forgotten or had an emergency.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Did you try to contact her?

DR. MORRISON: I sent an email that afternoon asking if she needed to reschedule.

DETECTIVE PARK: What about the evening of March 15th? Where were you?

DR. MORRISON: Here in my office, working late. I had several papers to review and some research data to analyze.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: What time did you arrive and leave that evening?

DR. MORRISON: I came back after dinner, around 7:00 PM. Left around 11:00.

DETECTIVE PARK: Did anyone see you here during those hours?

DR. MORRISON: [thinking] Dr. Peterson from the sociology department was here late. We spoke briefly in the hallway around 8:30.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Any other interactions that evening?

DR. MORRISON: The security guard made his rounds. And I believe I saw Sarah... oh, this is difficult to discuss.

DETECTIVE PARK: Please tell us what you saw.

DR. MORRISON: Around 8:00, I saw her through my window walking across the campus quad. She appeared to be on the phone with someone.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Are you certain it was Sarah?

DR. MORRISON: [pause] I thought it was. Blonde hair, blue backpack. But I was several floors up, so I can't be completely certain.

DETECTIVE PARK: Did you see where she went?

DR. MORRISON: She was walking toward the parking area, but then I returned to my work.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Dr. Morrison, have you ever had personal contact with Sarah outside of academic settings?

DR. MORRISON: [firmly] No. Absolutely not.

DETECTIVE PARK: No social interactions, chance meetings, anything like that?

DR. MORRISON: [hesitant] Well, I occasionally see students around town. It's a small university community.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Have you ever given Sarah rides or met her off-campus?

DR. MORRISON: [defensive] No. That would be inappropriate.

DETECTIVE PARK: Are you aware of any problems Sarah was having with other people?

DR. MORRISON: She mentioned her ex-boyfriend was being persistent. Marcus something. She seemed stressed about it.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Did she provide specifics about this ex-boyfriend?

DR. MORRISON: She said he wouldn't accept the breakup, kept contacting her. I suggested she contact campus security if it continued.

DETECTIVE PARK: Anyone else she mentioned having problems with?

DR. MORRISON: [thinking] She once mentioned feeling uncomfortable around the maintenance staff at her apartment. Said one of them seemed to watch her too closely.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Did she ask for your advice about that situation?

DR. MORRISON: I told her to report it to the building management if it continued.

DETECTIVE PARK: Dr. Morrison, have you ever called Sarah's personal phone number?

DR. MORRISON: [quickly] No. I only contact students through email or their university numbers.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Do you own any cell phones other than your primary number?

DR. MORRISON: Just my university-issued phone and my personal phone.

DETECTIVE PARK: Have you had any recent contact with Sarah outside of your scheduled meetings?

DR. MORRISON: [long pause] No. Our last communication was the email I sent Friday afternoon.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Is there anything else you think we should know about Sarah or her situation?

DR. MORRISON: [composed] She's a good student who's been under a lot of pressure. I hope she's safe and that this is just a misunderstanding.

DETECTIVE PARK: Some students have mentioned feeling uncomfortable with your meeting requests. Can you address that?

DR. MORRISON: [irritated] Graduate school is demanding. Students sometimes feel pressured when pushed to excel academically. That's the nature of rigorous education.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: Have you ever made personal comments to Sarah about her appearance or personal life?

DR. MORRISON: [firmly] My conversations with Sarah have been strictly academic. Any suggestion otherwise is inappropriate and false.

DETECTIVE PARK: Would you be willing to provide a DNA sample for elimination purposes?

DR. MORRISON: [hesitant] I... I suppose so, if it helps the investigation. Though I don't see how it's relevant.

DETECTIVE RODRIGUEZ: We appreciate your cooperation. Is there anything else you'd like to add?

DR. MORRISON: I just hope Sarah is found safe. She has a bright future ahead of her.
