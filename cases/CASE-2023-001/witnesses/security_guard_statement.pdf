STATEMENT REGARDING MARCH 15, 2023 OBSERVATIONS:

I am providing this statement regarding observations I made on the evening of March 15, 2023, while working my regular shift as a university security guard. I have been employed by the university for 8 years since retiring from the City Police Department after 20 years of service.

BACKGROUND:
On March 15, 2023, I was working the evening shift (3:00 PM to 11:00 PM) with primary responsibility for the library and surrounding academic buildings. This was a routine patrol night with normal student activity levels.

OBSERVATIONS OF SARAH MITCHELL:
I recognized Sarah Mitchell as a regular library user. She typically studied there 3-4 evenings per week and always seemed focused and well-behaved. On March 15th, I noticed her in the library around 4:30 PM when I did my afternoon security check.

EVENING EVENTS:
Around 7:30 PM, I was conducting my routine patrol of the library perimeter when I observed Sarah exiting through the main entrance. This seemed earlier than her usual departure time, which was typically around 9:00 or 9:30 PM.

UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR OBSERVED:
What caught my attention was that she appeared to be talking on her phone and seemed somewhat agitated or concerned. In the two years I had observed her routine, I had never seen her make phone calls while leaving the library. She usually kept her phone put away.

She was standing near the main entrance for several minutes talking on the phone. From my position about 50 feet away, I couldn't hear the conversation, but her body language suggested she was asking questions or seeking clarification about something.

DEPARTURE OBSERVATION:
After ending her phone call, Sarah looked around as if she was trying to decide which direction to go. This was also unusual because she typically had a very consistent routine - straight to the bus stop or toward the student parking area.

She eventually headed toward the southeast campus exit, which would take her in the direction of her apartment complex. I lost sight of her when she passed behind the science building.

TIMING DETAILS:
I checked my patrol log and confirmed these observations occurred between 7:25 and 7:35 PM. I made a note in my log about the unusual phone call because it stood out as different from her normal pattern.

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
During my years of police work, I developed habits of noticing when people's behavior patterns change. Sarah's demeanor that evening was noticeably different from her usual calm, focused routine.

SUBSEQUENT AWARENESS:
When I learned the next day that Sarah had been reported missing, I immediately thought about the phone call I had witnessed. I contacted Detective Rodriguez as soon as the investigation began to report my observations.

PRIOR INTERACTIONS:
In my role as security guard, I had minimal direct interaction with Sarah. She was always polite when our paths crossed, and I never observed any problems or concerns related to her safety on campus.

OTHER OBSERVATIONS THAT EVENING:
I saw no one following Sarah or paying unusual attention to her. Campus activity was normal for a Thursday evening. No suspicious vehicles or individuals were noted in my patrol reports.

PROFESSIONAL ASSESSMENT:
Based on my police experience, Sarah's behavior that evening suggested she had received unexpected information that required her to change her plans. The phone call appeared to be the catalyst for her early departure from the library.

I am prepared to testify in court if needed and have reviewed the security footage to confirm my observations match the recorded events.

STATEMENT ACCURACY:
I have read this statement and it is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and recollection.

INVESTIGATIVE NOTES:
Officer Torres provided valuable corroboration of the security footage timeline and behavioral observations. His law enforcement background adds credibility to his assessment of the victim's demeanor and the significance of the observed changes in routine.

His observations support the theory that Sarah received communication that caused her to alter her evening plans, consistent with the cell phone records showing the call from the unknown number.
