STATEMENT REGARDING DISCOVERY OF EVIDENCE:

My name is Robert Johnson and I am 67 years old. On January 10, 2024, my hiking partner William Williams and I were hiking on the Miller's Ridge trail system when we discovered what appeared to be a backpack partially buried under leaves and debris.

DISCOVERY DETAILS:
We started our hike around 1:00 PM from the main trailhead parking area. We've been hiking these trails for over 10 years and know them well. About 2 miles into our hike, approximately 50 feet off the main trail, I noticed what looked like fabric under a pile of leaves.

At first, I thought it might be an old camping item that someone had left behind, but when we got closer, I could see it was a backpack that appeared to have been there for quite some time. The area around it looked disturbed, like someone had tried to bury it or hide it under the fallen branches and leaves.

CONDITION OF DISCOVERY SITE:
- Backpack was about 50 feet from the main trail in dense woods
- Partially covered with leaves, branches, and forest debris
- Area showed signs of deliberate concealment rather than accidental loss
- We could see some personal items through the partially opened zippers
- The fabric was weathered but still intact

ACTIONS TAKEN:
We immediately recognized this could be important evidence. William stayed with the backpack while I hiked back to the parking area to call 911 on my cell phone. We did not touch or move the backpack or any of its contents.

Emergency dispatch connected me to Detective Thompson, who instructed us to mark the location and wait for police arrival. We used bright orange surveyor's tape from my hiking pack to mark the spot so officers could find it easily.

OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE AREA:
This location is not easily accessible to casual hikers. You have to know the area well to find this spot, and it requires deliberate effort to get there through thick brush. It's definitely not a place someone would go by accident.

The area showed signs that someone had been there and disturbed the ground. There were broken branches and what looked like tool marks in the soil around where the backpack was buried.

PRIOR KNOWLEDGE:
We were aware of the missing student case from news reports last year. When we saw the university ID card visible in the backpack, we immediately thought this could be related to Sarah Mitchell's disappearance. That's why we were so careful not to disturb anything.

ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS:
- Weather conditions that day were clear and dry
- We saw no other hikers in that area during our visit
- No vehicle tracks or recent camping evidence in the vicinity
- The backpack appeared to have been there for an extended period

I am willing to testify in court if needed and cooperate fully with the investigation.

STATEMENT ACCURACY:
I have read this statement and it is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and recollection.
