PERSONAL DIARY - SARAH MITCHELL

[FORENSIC ANALYSIS: Handwriting verified as victim's - Dr. Reynolds, Document Examiner]

February 28, 2023

Still can't believe Marcus and I are really over. It's probably for the best, but it's hard seeing him around campus. He texted me again today asking to "talk things through" but I think we've said everything we need to say. Jennifer thinks I should block his number, but that seems harsh. He's not a bad person, just... intense. Sometimes too intense.

Dr. Morrison wants to meet about my thesis again. I swear he schedules more meetings than necessary. The way he looks at me during our sessions makes me uncomfortable, but maybe I'm reading too much into it. He's been helpful with my research, I guess.

Marcus showed up at the apartment today. He used his old key - I forgot he still had one. Thank god Jennifer was there. He said he just wanted to "check on me" but it felt wrong. I asked for the key back and he got really defensive, saying I was "overreacting" and that he was just "being a good friend." 

Changed the locks tomorrow. Tommy from maintenance said he could do it first thing in the morning. He's always so eager to help... almost too eager. The way he lingers when he's fixing things in our apartment is kind of weird. Always finds excuses to come by.

March 8, 2023

Had another meeting with Dr. Morrison today. He suggested we meet at his office after hours to "avoid distractions." When I mentioned I prefer daytime meetings, he said something about how "serious research requires serious commitment" and that successful graduate students need to be "flexible." I left feeling really uncomfortable.

Talking to other female grad students, and it seems like he has a pattern. Sarah K. mentioned he made similar comments to her last semester. We're thinking about talking to the department head.

Tommy fixed the bathroom faucet today, but I noticed he was going through my medicine cabinet. When I asked what he was doing, he said he was "checking for water damage behind the mirror." That doesn't make sense - the faucet problem was completely unrelated.

Found out from Jennifer that he's asked other tenants about my schedule. Specifically when I'm usually home alone. Mrs. Patterson in 3A said he asked her when I typically go to the library. That's... concerning.

Thinking about mentioning this to the apartment manager.

====================================================================

March 14, 2023 (DAY BEFORE DISAPPEARANCE)

Something really strange happened today. Got a call from a number I didn't recognize. When I answered, the person hung up. Then they called back and asked if this was "Sarah from the psychology department." I said yes, and they said they had "information about Dr. Morrison" and wanted to meet.

I'm supposed to meet them tomorrow evening after I leave the library. They wouldn't give their name but said it was about "what he's been doing to students." Part of me thinks I should tell someone where I'm going, but they insisted on secrecy. Said Dr. Morrison has "connections" in the administration.

Marcus texted me today too. Said he "knows what's going on" and wants to help. I have no idea what he's talking about. He's been acting stranger since we broke up.

Tommy was in the laundry room when I went to wash clothes. He made some comment about my "pretty blue backpack" and how I carry it everywhere. Why is he paying attention to what I carry? It's getting creepy.

I'm starting to feel like everyone is watching me. Maybe I'm just paranoid because of everything with the thesis and the breakup, but something feels off.

Jennifer is working late tomorrow, so I'll be coming home to an empty apartment. Maybe I should ask her to change her plans, but I don't want to worry her unnecessarily.

====================================================================

March 15, 2023 - MORNING ENTRY (FINAL ENTRY)

Didn't sleep well last night. Keep thinking about that phone call. Part of me wants to just ignore it and not show up, but if Dr. Morrison really has been inappropriate with other students, I need to know.

Marcus sent another text this morning asking to meet. I'm getting tired of this. Going to tell him clearly that we need space.

Meeting with the mystery caller tonight at 8:30. They said to meet near the old maintenance building behind the apartments - it's private and Dr. Morrison never goes there. They'll call me when I'm leaving the library to confirm the location.

If anything happens to me, I want people to know that I was trying to do the right thing. I just want to finish my degree and move on with my life.

Going to spend the day at the library working on my thesis. At least that feels normal.
