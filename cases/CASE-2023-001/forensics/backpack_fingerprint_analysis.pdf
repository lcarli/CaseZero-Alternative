FORENSIC LABORATORY REPORT
FINGERPRINT ANALYSIS

CASE NUMBER: CASE-2023-001
LAB CASE NUMBER: FP-2024-0089
EVIDENCE ITEM: Backpack and Contents
SUBMITTED BY: Detective Thompson
DATE RECEIVED: January 11, 2024
DATE COMPLETED: January 12, 2024
ANALYST: Officer Rebecca Martinez, Certified Latent Print Examiner
REVIEWER: Sergeant David Liu, Senior Fingerprint Analyst

====================================================================

EVIDENCE EXAMINED:
- Blue hiking backpack exterior surfaces
- Metal zippers and buckles
- Water bottle and cap
- Student ID card and lanyard
- Personal diary cover and pages

PROCESSING METHODS USED:
- Visual examination under white light and alternate light sources
- Superglue fuming (cyanoacrylate) for plastic surfaces
- Magnetic powder dusting for metal surfaces
- Iodine fuming for paper surfaces
- Digital photography for all developed prints

====================================================================

FINGERPRINT EXAMINATION RESULTS:

BACKPACK ZIPPER (Main Compartment):
- 3 latent prints recovered suitable for comparison
- Classification: Loops and whorl patterns
- Quality: Good ridge detail, suitable for identification
- Comparison result: IDENTIFICATION to Sarah Mitchell (victim)
- Additional partial print: IDENTIFICATION to Thomas Brennan

BACKPACK SHOULDER STRAP (Left):
- 2 latent prints recovered
- Classification: Loop patterns
- Quality: Excellent ridge detail
- Comparison result: IDENTIFICATION to Thomas Brennan
- Points of comparison: 14 ridge characteristics matched

BACKPACK SHOULDER STRAP (Right):
- 1 complete latent print
- Classification: Whorl pattern
- Quality: Good ridge detail
- Comparison result: IDENTIFICATION to Thomas Brennan
- Points of comparison: 16 ridge characteristics matched

WATER BOTTLE (Exterior):
- 4 latent prints recovered
- Primary prints: IDENTIFICATION to Sarah Mitchell
- Secondary prints: IDENTIFICATION to Thomas Brennan
- Distribution pattern suggests handling by both individuals

WATER BOTTLE CAP:
- 2 overlapping latent prints
- Primary print: IDENTIFICATION to Sarah Mitchell
- Secondary print: IDENTIFICATION to Thomas Brennan
- Quality sufficient for court presentation

STUDENT ID CARD:
- Multiple latent prints on plastic surface
- All prints: IDENTIFICATION to Sarah Mitchell
- No foreign prints detected on card surface

DIARY COVER:
- 6 latent prints recovered from leather surface
- All prints: IDENTIFICATION to Sarah Mitchell
- No foreign prints detected

====================================================================

COMPARISON STANDARDS:
- Sarah Mitchell: Known prints from personal items (hairbrush, mirror)
- Thomas Brennan: Prints on file from 2021 arrest record
- Elimination prints: Discovery witnesses (negative comparison)

====================================================================

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:

PRINT QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
- All identified prints meet court testimony standards
- Ridge characteristics clearly visible and countable
- No distortion or artifacts affecting identification
- Sufficient points of comparison for positive identification

DEPOSITION ANALYSIS:
- Brennan prints show normal pressure and contact patterns
- Distribution suggests natural handling of backpack straps
- Overlapping prints indicate extended contact with items
- No evidence of glove use or print elimination attempts

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS:
- Some degradation consistent with 10-month outdoor exposure
- Plastic surfaces preserved prints better than fabric
- Metal surfaces showed good print retention
- No contamination from discovery environment

====================================================================

CONCLUSIONS:

1. Sarah Mitchell's fingerprints found on all personal items as expected

2. Thomas Brennan's fingerprints found on:
   - Both backpack shoulder straps (multiple locations)
   - Main compartment zipper
   - Water bottle exterior and cap

3. The presence and distribution of Brennan's prints indicates:
   - Direct physical handling of the backpack
   - Carrying or moving the backpack by shoulder straps
   - Contact with water bottle (handling contents)

4. No other individuals' prints detected on examined items

5. Print patterns consistent with Brennan having carried or transported the backpack

====================================================================

EXPERT OPINION:
The fingerprint evidence strongly indicates that Thomas Brennan had direct physical contact with Sarah Mitchell's backpack and personal items. The location and quality of prints suggest more than casual contact.

COURT TESTIMONY AVAILABLE:
Officer Martinez is qualified to provide expert testimony regarding these findings and has testified in over 200 cases involving fingerprint identification.

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
- All identifications verified through ACE-V methodology
- Independent verification completed by second examiner
- Photographic documentation maintains chain of custody
- Electronic records backed up on secure forensic servers

====================================================================

PHOTOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTATION:
- 27 photographs documenting all recovered prints
- Before and after processing photos for each surface
- Comparison charts showing matching ridge characteristics
- All images available for discovery and court presentation
