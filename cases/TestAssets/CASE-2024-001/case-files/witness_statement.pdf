STATEMENT:
I was conducting my regular rounds when I noticed the motion sensor light in the lobby activate at approximately 2:15 AM. This was unusual as the building should have been empty.

I immediately checked the security monitors and observed an individual dressed in dark clothing entering through the main entrance. The person appeared to know the building layout and proceeded directly to the elevator.

I called the police immediately and continued monitoring. The suspect spent approximately 10 minutes on the third floor before exiting through the same entrance. They appeared to be carrying something that wasn't visible when they entered.

I have been working security for this building for 3 years and have never witnessed anything like this before. The suspect seemed familiar with our security system and avoided several camera angles.
